It started as a simple idea, but through dedication, problem solving, and design we soon realized to turn this idea of ours into an App would take some serious dedication, passion and vision. Two years in the making, little did we know it but creating a working Application out of words, arrows and numbered sequences jotted down on a large whiteboard was a little daunting and we still didn’t have a name. A name that was describing, an adjective or a play on words (was the thought process), a process that had us checking over 1000’s of names for weeks. The list of names had to be checked, double checked and triple checked to make sure they were available. \'Fixezi-The App of All Trades’ was born, a trade based advertising application for smart phones and website that can be used by every house/property owner, business or realtor or even another tradesmen looking for qualified, reliable, quality tradesmen.</string>
